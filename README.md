# Traffic Light Simulation with Arduino and 16x2 LCD

Overview

This project simulates a traffic light system using an Arduino and a 16x2 LCD display. The LEDs represent the traffic lights (red, yellow, and green), while the LCD shows the current light status and countdown timer.

Features

Traffic Light Simulation with LEDs and LCD display
LCD Display: Shows current light status (e.g., "Green Light" or "Red Light") and countdown timer
Automated Timing: Controls the light sequence timing using the Arduino
Components Used
Arduino Uno (or compatible board)
Red, Yellow, and Green LEDs
330Ω Resistors (for each LED)
16x2 LCD Display with I2C module (for easier wiring)
Breadboard and Jumper Wires
