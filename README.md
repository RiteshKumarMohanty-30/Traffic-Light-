# Traffic Light Simulation with Arduino and 16x2 LCD

# Overview

This project simulates a traffic light system using an Arduino and a 16x2 LCD display. The LEDs represent the traffic lights (red, yellow, and green), while the LCD shows the current light status and countdown timer.

# Features:

Traffic Light Simulation with LEDs and LCD display
LCD Display: Shows current light status (e.g., "Green Light" or "Red Light") and countdown timer
Automated Timing: Controls the light sequence timing using the Arduino

# Components Used:

Arduino Uno (or compatible board)
Red, Yellow, and Green LEDs
330Î© Resistors (for each LED)
16x2 LCD Display with I2C module (for easier wiring)
Breadboard and Jumper Wires
